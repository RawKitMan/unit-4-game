Crystal Game With Javascript


For this project, I created a game where the player is given a random number and four crystals, each containing a hidden random value. The player must click on the crystals to accumulate points to try match the random number above. If the player matches the total value with the random number, the player wins. If the player goes over, the player loses.

There's not much that could be added to the project other than maybe adding a few messages here and there to indicate if the player won or lost.
